# GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment

The R file, 'run_analysis.R', does the following:

1. Loads the downloaded dataset from the UCI repository.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Renames the variables to more descriptive activity names
4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
